# Enhancing Tropical Cyclone Intensity Predictions Using Machine Learning Models
### Overview
+ Forecasting tropical cyclone intensity in the Atlantic basin has been a longstanding and intricate task, drawing extensive research and operational focus. To address this challenge, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) machine learning model was devised to predict changes in maximum wind speed for these cyclones. Leveraging global data from the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) and subject to rigorous evaluation through a leave-one-year-out (LOYO) testing approach, the MLP model demonstrated remarkable accuracy in forecasting wind speed changes and rapid intensification events. Comparative analysis with other models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Lasso Regression revealed the MLP model's superior performance, as evidenced by various key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R^2 score, Mean Error (ME), and Standard Deviation (STD). The MLP model exhibits promising potential to significantly enhance operational forecasts of tropical cyclone intensity, while also serving as a valuable tool for generating synthetic cyclones to advance climate research endeavors.
